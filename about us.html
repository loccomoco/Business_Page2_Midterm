Our main focus is always on the client’s business model and plans. We have never believed that the<br>right approach to every situation is “more hardware”. Instead, we spend as much time looking at the<br>business goals of the clients as we do looking at the enterprise computing issues at hand. Our focus<br>truly is on your business, and we believe that the more we know about how your company works,<br>the more precise our solution will be.
<br><br>
Our computer technicians and engineers are all CompTIA A+, Network+ & Microsoft qualified and able<br>to help troubleshoot issues with Microsoft Windows devices, as well as Android, Apple MacOS,<br>and iPhone iOS mobile devices. We can also help with broadband issues and network faults including WiFi<br>blackspots and poor connectivity issues. MCS engineers and computer technicians can accompany you<br>to and from the shops, lend a helping hand until your unit and computer are in operational.</p>
